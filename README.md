## Instructions

The games starts to run right a way when you open it in your browser. Of course you notice that by the enemie bugs that cross the screen horizontally.

Start playing by moving the little boy with the arrow keys:

arrow left: step one tile left
arrow right: step one tile right
arrow up: step one tile up
arrow down: step one tile down

Your goal is to lead the boy right away to the water by not beeing touched by the bugs crossing.

When reaching the water, after a short timeout your player will bereplaced to the starting point. 
The same thin occurs immediately when beeing hit by an enemy.


## Contributing

I am contributing to the Udacity FEND team for providing us the starter code which contains a lot of support such as the game engine, the graphics and the index.html

All the work we had to do concentrates on the app.js file.

Have fun, Frank
